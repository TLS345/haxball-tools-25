# Day 25/365 - Map Commands 🗺️

A simple Haxball Headless script that adds several map-related commands to your room.  
Each command can only be used when the match is **not running**, ensuring fair gameplay and stability.

## 🔧 Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `!x4` | Sets the map to **Classic** |
| `!x5` | Sets the map to **Big** |
| `!x7` | Sets the map to **Small** |
| `!rs` | Placeholder for future "RS Mode" functions |

## 🧠 Logic
- Commands are ignored if the game is currently active.
- Stadiums change immediately after executing the command.
- RS Mode will later include advanced features.

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Add real RS Arena map
- Allow admin-only command restriction
- Auto-save last map choice
